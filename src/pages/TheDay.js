      For our wedding, we want to <strong>make unforgettable memories with all of our loved ones </strong>
      and of course <strong>have a truck-load of fun!</strong> So be ready for a wedding made for fun, with accents
      of tradition throughout the evening.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>For the event schedule</strong> we first will have a brief ceremony, immediately followed up by a
      cocktail hour, and finally the reception. More to come on the detailed schedule! After the ceremony, we will have
      lawn games, drinks, music, and dancing for the rest of the evening. We invite you to find what's most fun for
      you and enjoy yourself at any point after the ceremony!
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>For dinner and refreshments</strong> we plan on having everything you'll need to enjoy yourself, 
      including beer, wine, and food. Catering will be provided by Open Hearth Pizza, which includes pizza (of course)
      along with salad and other hor d'euvres.
